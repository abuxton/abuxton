Coffee addicted, professional consultant, with a background in solving other peoples problems with them not for them and teaching people how to adopt new technology, IaC, and DevOps from concepts to process. My life is a constant round of "could you, should you and would you?" it's like "kiss, marry or avoid" for technology related products.
