Coffee-addicted, professional consultant, with a background in solving other people's problems with them, not for them, and teaching people how to adopt new technology, IaC, and DevOps from concepts to process. My life is a constant round of "could you, should you, and would you?" It's like "kiss, marry, or avoid" but for technology-related products.

### My User Manual
|   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|
| Conditions I like to work in. <br/> I am odd, I either like being at the front of a room with a whiteboard illustrating solutions and architecting plans, flows and concepts or in isolated environments,<br/>  if my headset is on, probably best to Slack me.   | The times/hours I like to work;<br/> - I'm an early bird, but I respect our global challenges.<br/> - You'll find me on Slack from 8 am, and still paying attention during most workday evenings.<br/> - Friday is sacred; don't push your luck.   | The best ways to communicate with me;<br/> - Slack for quick things.<br/> -  email for complex questions that need evidence and answers.<br/> - For your own safety, don't send me a screen grab when you can copy-paste an error message.  |  The ways I like to receive feedback are honestly, directly, and with good communication. <br/> People generally suck at all three so that's a fun stance.  |   
| Things I need. I like to be involved, I like to see overcommunication about what is developing and ideas, I don't mind not being involved directly, but I hate things that creep out of the woodwork due to bad communication.| Things I struggle with: <br/> - Opinions with no basis, lack of evidence, and not understanding wider plans and processes. <br/> - Bad communicators, or a lack of communication.   | Things I love: Coffee, smiles, and natural fun interchanges while brainstorming.   | Other things to know about me: <br/> - I'm Dyspraxic, and the later in the week it gets, the more people I've had to interact with, the closer I get to burnout and introversion.<br/> -  I call it people points, and they get used up.  |

Here are a few things to read to understand my views of the world.

* https://www.jrothman.com/mpd/management/2014/08/people-are-not-resources/ Why yes, this is a long-held belief.  
* https://medium.com/notbinary/people-are-not-resources-13ac7a380f95 Just in case you thought it wasn't still a problem.
* https://ipstenu.org/2011/the-scotty-principle/ Software and engineering people generally suck at scoping time and level of effort; if we all applied the Scotty principle, we'd be better and still not give ourselves enough.
* DevOps is the combination of Responsibilities, Capabilities and Communication in your organisation. Both in a passive product or tools, the capability to both communicate and provide capabilities, and a person's active role in providing capabilities and communicating their responsibilities to provide the subset of those capabilities they are responsible for. <https://www.astroarch.com/tvp_strategy/devops-engineer-25120/>.
* <https://dev.to/dvddpl/make-mistakes-and-ask-questions-its-ok-gah> but also <https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask>
* Automating things is hard, it's not just about how, it's about should you, when should you, and should you let the automation run <https://blog.danslimmon.com/2019/07/15/do-nothing-scripting-the-key-to-gradual-automation/> This helps with that conversation.
