### My User Manual
|   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|
| Conditions I like to Work in.<br/> I am odd. I either like being at the front of a room with a whiteboard illustrating solutions and architecting plans, flows and concepts or<br /> isolated environments, if my headset is on, probably best Slack me.   | The times/hours I like to work; I'm an early bird, but I respect our global challenges. you'll find me on Slack from 8 am, and still paying attention during most workday evenings. But Friday is sacred; don't push your luck.   | The best ways to communicate with me are Slack for quick things and email for complex questions that need evidence and answers. For your own safety, don't send me a screen grab when you can copy-paste an error message.  |  The ways I like to receive feedback are honestly, directly, and with good communication. People generally suck at all three so that's a fun stance.  |   
| Things I need. I like to be involved, I like to see overcommunication about what is developing and ideas, I don't mind not being involved directly but I hate things that creep out of the woodwork due to bad communication.| Things I struggle with; Opinions with no basis, lack of evidence, and not understanding wider plans and processes. Bad communicators, or lack of communication.   | Things I love: Coffee, smiles, and natural fun interchanges while brainstorming.   | Other things to know about me: I'm Dyspraxic, and the later in the week it gets, and the more people I've had to interact with, the closer I get to burnout and introverting. I call it people points, and they get used up.  |
